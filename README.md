## Functionality Requirements

The component should perform the following validations for a product form:

- The Product name input field should pass the following validations. In case of error, the appropriate message should be shown in `<p data-testid="name-input-error"></p>`. This `<p>` tag should be rendered only when field is not valid. Hence, on app load it should not be rendered.
  - The field is required.
    - For this error show the message `Product name is required`.

- The Quantity input field should pass following validations. In case of error, the appropriate message should be shown in `<p data-testid="quantity-input-error"></p>`. This `<p>` tag should be rendered only when field is not valid. Hence, on app load it should not be rendered.
  - The field is required.
    - For this error show the message `Quantity is required`.

- When fields are invalid, the submit button should be disabled. Hence, initially, the button is disabled.
- Validations are triggered when input fields are touched for the first time.
- When all fields are valid and touched, the submit button should be enabled.
- To achieve same interface as shown in demo, when validation fails, add class `error`Â to inputs. Please note that this is not a requirement and only for CSS purpose. Tests do not test this.

## Testing Requirements

The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

- The product name input: `name-input`
- The quantity input: `quantity-input`
- The submit button: `submit-button`
- The container having the error message for:
  - the product name input field: `name-input-error`
  - the quantity input field: `quantity-input-error`
